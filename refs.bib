   abstract = {Acute colonic diverticulitis (ACD) is an acute episode of severe and prolonged lower abdominal pain due to diverticular inflammation, usually associated with change in bowel movements, fever, and leukocytosis. Worldwide, computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis with intravenous contrast is accepted as the best imaging method for evaluating the diverticular inflammation, serving the following functions: confirming the presence of ACD; evaluation of the disease severity and degree; therapy planning guide in presence of complications (such as abscess or intestinal perforation); diagnosis of other diseases that may simulate diverticular inflammation. In the literature, we found values of CT sensitivity for diverticular inflammation from 79% to 99%; CT is useful in differentiating other diseases, which may cause abdominal pain, when diverticular inflammation is not the cause, such as neoplasm, inflammatory bowel disease, appendix inflammations, epiploic appendix inflammation and colon ischemia. The trick to differentiate diverticulitis from other inflammatory diseases that involve the colon is the identification of diverticula in the pathological intestinal loop. In the last years, a radiological classification was created in order to guide the management of ACD in patients treated conservatively or with interventional procedures. The new classification system divides ACD into two groups: complicated and uncomplicated. Uncomplicated ACD is defined if only thickening of the intestinal wall is present, with increase of the perivisceral fat density. Complicated ACD is divided into 4 stages, depending on presence of microperforation without abscess and/or peritoneum involvement (stage 1 A), presence of abscess with diameter </=4 cm (stage 1 B), presence of abscess with diameter >4 cm (stage 2 A), presence of distant air >5 cm from the pathological loop (stage 2 B), presence of diffuse fluid in at least two distant abdominal quadrants without distant free air (stage 3), presence of diffuse fluid and distant free air (stage 4). In this pictorial essay, we describe CT findings of the ACD and explain classification of the disease and its common and uncommon complications.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diverticulosis of the appendix is an uncommon clinical entity, and a preoperative diagnosis is often difficult. Herein we report an unusual case of appendiceal diverticulosis. CASE PRESENTATION: A 72-year-old male was referred to our hospital to examine the cause of hematochezia. A colonoscopy study showed a protruding lesion resembling a submucosal tumor (SMT), approximately 20 mm in diameter, at the site around the appendiceal orifice of the cecum. An abdominal computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed a cystic lesion at the appendiceal base. The lesion was clinically diagnosed as a cystic tumor of the appendix, but the possibility of a malignant tumor could not be excluded. Therefore, a laparoscopic ileocecal resection with lymph node dissection was performed. The pathological examination of the resected specimen revealed that the lesion was a diverticulum (pseudodiverticulum) occurring solitarily at the appendiceal base, in which the mucosal layer of the appendix was invaginated into the submucosa of the adjacent cecum, thus forming an SMT-like lesion. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first case report in the English literature showing that an appendiceal diverticulum can manifest as an SMT-like lesion in the cecum. This condition should be recognized as a differential diagnosis for such lesions.},
